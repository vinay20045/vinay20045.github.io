                <h2>Scoring 8.5 in IELTS Academic</h2>
<h5>Last Updated: 10 January, 2021 | First Published: 14 October, 2012</h5>
<p><em>"IELTS is the world's proven English test. More people go more places with IELTS...."</em>. This is what they tell about IELTS exam on their web site <a href="http://www.ielts.org/" title="IELTS website">www.ielts.org</a>. A little less pompous, neutral and community edited information about the IELTS exam can be found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IELTS" title="Wikipedia page on IELTS">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>IELTS has 2 versions. Academic and General Training. I recently took IELTS Academic test along with a bunch of friends. My results are as follows: <br />
Listening - 9.0 | Reading - 8.5 | Speaking - 8.0 | Writing - 7.5 <br />
<strong>Overall Band Score - 8.5 on 9.0</strong></p>
<p>Pretty pathetic right?! I expected a 9 overall with at least 8.5 in each section. Considering the fact that I have learnt English right from kindergarten, it was very disheartening to see that the kind lady who took my speaking test gave me an 8. I was not surprised to see a 7.5 in writing (My hand writing was bad and it has become even worse after I started doing all my "writing" on my laptop).</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources out there on the internet that tell you what to do and how to prepare. Some of them are <a href="http://www.ielts-blog.com/" title="IELTS prep blog">www.ielts-blog.com</a>, <a href="http://www.ielts.org/" title="IELTS website">www.ielts.org</a>, and the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/france-english-exams-ielts-preparation-hints.htm" title="British Council">British Council site</a>. I am writing this article in retrospection, to analyze what I did wrong and what I should have done in the hope that it will come in handy for a fellow test taker.</p>
<p>I signed up with <a href="http://www.india.idp.com/">IDP</a> to take the test. Once I signed up they gave me a book. A very nice book published by <a href="http://www.insearch.edu.au/" title="UTS Insearch">UTS Insearch</a>, Australia. The book was good. It had 5 practice tests in each section. It even had 3 CD's which simulated the actual listening test environment (did a pretty neat job too). Lots of tips and tricks. A detailed explanation of the exam pattern. Picture based explanation of the answer sheets. I started preparing from this book. I used to take it up in the evenings and weekends and had soon read the book from end to end and completed all the practice tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>I never bothered to pick up another book or any other material to prepare. This was my <strong>1st mistake</strong>. I should have picked up one other material (at least) and prepared from it too. </li>
</ul>
<p>I was particularly scared of the listening section. With the exception of a few American friends, it was a long time since I had a discussion with any other native English speakers. So, I took a lot of listening tests available freely on the internet and looks like it paid off. Therefore, no complaints here.</p>
<p>The academic essays that are presented in the reading section are quite difficult. Also, more than 50% of the questions are never straight forward. I had never scored full in the reading section even in my practice tests. I'd definitely like to think that I have gotten only one answer wrong in the reading section but I'll never know. Since I am used to reading English newspaper every morning, I didn't think I fell short on preparation for this section. Therefore, I have no complaints here either.</p>
<p>Coming down to the Speaking section. My speaking test was scheduled to be held a day before the remaining sections. It was in an area in the city which I seldom visited.</p>
<ul>
<li>I never bothered to check out the venue before the exam, because of this oversight I had to almost walk a kilometer from my vehicle to the venue after parking, I was all sweaty, puffing and panting. This was my <strong>2nd mistake</strong>. I should have checked out the exam venue in advance and found out the right place to park the vehicle.</li>
<li>Having little familiarity with the place, I ended up miscalculating the time I needed to reach the venue. This was my <strong>3rd mistake</strong>. I was late. I don't have to tell you what I should have done. But, it turned out that the speaking test for the candidates before me had overshot the schedule thereby making my late arrival go unnoticed :-).</li>
<li>I had only read the transcripts of sample speaking tests that were given in the book, effectively not practicing for this section at all. I didn't think I needed to practice speaking. This was my <strong>4th mistake</strong>. I should have caught hold of some friend or a family member and practiced one or two speaking tests with them. I could have used a recorder too. Though I am generally very articulate, when it came to an exam environment I think I had some issues in even telling something about myself.</li>
<li>I was fast. I spoke too fast at times. This was my <strong>5th mistake</strong>. I could realize that I was going too fast when I was answering some questions. At one point in time I think the examiner asked me to repeat. Though I handled the situation well, It probably added to the fact that I got only 8 on 9 in this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, the writing section. I love writing but like I said before I was not surprised when I saw a 7.5 in writing. I know I don't have the prettiest of hand writing but I do write legibly (Honestly).</p>
<ul>
<li>Scratches and rewrites. This was my <strong>6th mistake</strong>. This is generally not a mistake, you know it is pretty common. But, given my hand writing I should have been more careful to avoid scratches and rewrites.</li>
<li>I finished well ahead of time. This was my <strong>7th mistake</strong>. You would think that this is a good thing right?! I don't think so. I now feel that I should have factored in that extra time to better my essay(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>There... Retrospection complete. These are the mistakes I made in the course of getting an 8.5 on 9 in IELTS academic exam.</p>
