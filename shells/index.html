                            <p>A highly motivated engineer with demonstrated technical &amp; leadership capabilities. I am passionate about building high performing, autonomous engineering teams and inspiring them to bring ideas to life in the form of simple yet effective products. Welcome to my website.</p>
                            <p>Took a chance and started my first company (<a href="#">V Solutions</a>) while still in college. Since then, have built and led high performing engineering teams at my own startup (<a href="https://int.ai/" target="_BLANK">int.ai</a>), other tech driven startups (<a href="https://commonfloor.com/" target="_BLANK">CommonFloor</a>, <a href="https://practo.com/" target="_BLANK">Practo</a>) and large companies (<a href="https://seller.flipkart.com/" target="_BLANK">FlipKart</a>, <a href="https://careers.walmart.com/technology/technology-software-development/walmart-labs/" target="_BLANK">Walmart</a>).</p>
                            <p>I am married to my college sweetheart <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/poornimavinaykumar" alt="My super talented wife!!" target="_BLANK">Poornima</a>. We currently live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore" target="_BLANK">Bangalore, India</a> and have lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago" target="_BLANK">Santiago, Chile</a> in the recent past. </p>
                            <p>Over the last ~15 years, I've worked on everything from simple prototypes, MVPs to complex backends, APIs, SaaS products to large scale distributed systems and data pipelines.
                            <p>Here to mostly write about leadership, sofware engineering, system design, product development and related topics. I also love to teach developers about large scale system design.</p>
