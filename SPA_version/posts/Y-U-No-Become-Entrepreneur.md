Y U No Become Entrepreneur??
----------------------------

Recently, I gave a talk to a class of engineering students at Universidad Adolfo Ibanez in Santiago, Chile. It was a general talk about entrepreneurship. Here is the transcript of the talk along with the relevant slides, modified slightly for the current format. Only the first few lines are in Spanish :)

Hola Chicos!! Buena tardes. Mi nombre es Vinay NP. Soy el co founder y CTO de Int Data Labs. Este es mi roto intento de hablar espanol. Y obviamente no hablo espanol bien. So, I'm going to stick to English from now on...   

At Int Data Labs we are building a virtual business analyst bot using machine learning and AI technologies. We want to disrupt the multi billion dollar business process outsourcing industry by getting enterprises to adopt our technology as an alternate to outsourcing their data analysis and business intelligence requirements.

I am from a beautiful city in India called Bangalore. I am an Engineer, majored in Computer Science. Int Data Labs is my 2nd venture as a founder. I've also worked in several engineering leadership and consultant capacities in startups and well as bigger companies.

Now... I'm not here to motivate you to become entrepreneurs... That!! you have to figure out for yourself!! But, I'm here to tell you my story, why I do what I do and why I try so hard everyday despite the failures, the fear, the frustration. I will do this by sharing some anecdotes and 3 important lessons that I've learnt in this journey, so far...

When I was in high school, What I wanted to be would vary from a stud farm owner to an astronaut. But never an Engineer or an Entrepreneur. Honestly, had it not been for my uncle's insistence I would not have gotten into an engineering college at all. I too went through the motions of going to college everyday, studying, writing exams, listening to lectures and as expected I was bored, I could solve most problems before they were taught in class and college did not challenge me anymore. I used to hate going to college. Therefore, just like any of you in my situation, I decided to add some drama into my life and got myself a girl friend!! Then one day something happened!! When I was in my 3rd year of engineering my girl friend's brother asked me if I could build a website for him. To impress my girl friend I said yes, even though I did not know how. He told me to get on with it and somehow 1 week later I was there with a fully functional website. This was the start. From then on, I've worked with more than 500 companies, built and lead several teams of talented people, earned and lost several millions. None of these things would have happened, had I not said yes that day. And that leads to my 1st lesson, Never say no to an opportunity.

Some years later, I left my first venture and joined another startup which was running one of India's largest real estate portals at the time. I started out leading a small team of 4 engineers. Within a year and a half, I was leading several teams, was promoted multiple times and had earned my place at the table. At one point in time, during transition, I was heading an entire engineering org. This place gave me an opportunity to experiment all my theories about product development, project management and people management. Every day would be a huge rush of information and learning. Even though all these great things were happening, The origin story of me getting hired by this company was itself really funny. I picked up the phone of the recruiter in her last attempt at calling me. I was not very serious about the first phone interview. The recruiter scheduled a face to face interview by mistake and that too on a holiday. The CTO was present in the office at my scheduled time by chance and later told me that he was about to leave before I arrived. Yet, he hired me on the spot, gave me more money than I asked for and that stint was my most fulfilling stint till date. In fact, It is because of that stint that I'm a better entrepreneur today!! This and many more such instances has made me a firm believer that nothing happens by chance and everything is by design!! And that's lesson number 2.

Let's talk about people. People around you will expect a lot out of you. You will expect a lot out of yourself. But, the truth often is, expectation is a lot different from reality. In college, I told my professor that I want time off from classes because I was doing business, he was pissed. I told my mom that I will not be focusing much on studies because I wanted to business, she was pissed. I told my friends that I will not be coming to campus placements with them because I already had a job, they were pissed. In my last job, I told my boss in the very first team meeting that things were moving terribly slow and everyone in the room were pissed. Most recently I told a VC, that we are not going to be doing what he told, he was pissed. I mean, I piss off a lot of people on a weekly basis. And almost all the time that is because of expectation mis match. If you're pissing a lot of people off there are 2 possibilities. Either, you are on the right track, doing great but you just don't know it yet or you are just a stupid moron. In any case you cannot be afraid to piss people off. And that's lesson number 3.

I started my first venture when I was in my 3rd year of engineering. From then till now I've experienced several days of dread & fear and several more days of absolute bliss & pleasure. My first pay check from a customer was for ~400 dollars, US dollars. This was when most of my friends were still asking their parents for pocket money. A lot of people called me stupid when I left my high paying job to start up again. Yet, I do the work that I love, I get a chance to travel across the world. I can meet and make friends with some really intelligent and smart people. I learn. I live. Every single day. All thanks to the path I've chosen.   

I want to leave you with just one thought to carry home this evening. There are too many normal people doing normal things... Greatness comes out of normal people trying to do different things. It's time YOU did something different!!   

Thank You!!
