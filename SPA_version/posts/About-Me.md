About Me

_"You say that you love rain,   
but you open your umbrella when it rains...   
You say that you love the sun,   
but you find a shadow spot when the sun shines...   
You say that you love the wind,   
But you close your windows when wind blows...   
This is why I am afraid;   
You say that you love me too..."_

English translation of Turkish poem **Korkuyorum**

I am [Vinay Kumar NP][0]. I am a passionate techie and love the kick that building stuff gives. This is where I express my take on things. I come from Bangalore, India but am currently residing in Santiago, Chile. I started out as a student entrepreneur. I architect web apps, write code and love food.

I am currently working on a [startup][1] of my own. I have previously worked in various engineering leadership positions at [CommonFloor][2], [FlipKart][3] and [Practo][4]. I also work with several startups as a technical consultant.

I am married to my sweet heart [Poornima][5], whom I'd been seeing from my college days. I love dogs but don't have one. I love writing but get very little time to do so. I like singing but sound terrible when I do.

The best and the fastest way to reach me is by sending a mail to <vinay@askvinay.com>. I do reply to all mails but I might not be able to revert immediately on specific requests for scripts or support.
