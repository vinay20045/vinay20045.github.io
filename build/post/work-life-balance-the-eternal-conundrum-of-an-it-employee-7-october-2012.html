                <h2>Work - Life balance: The eternal conundrum of an IT employee</h2>
<h5>Last Updated: 7 October, 2012 | First Published: 7 October, 2012</h5>
<p><em>"There is no secret ingredient"</em> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda">Kung Fu Panda</a> is what immediately pops to my mind when I start thinking about this. What is that one thing I can do to achieve this?? What is it that will allow me to spend a little more quality time with my family?? There exists many answers but not one that works in its entirety.</p>
<p>A few years ago when I started a small business, I was still in college. Typically, I used to be in college all day and spend my evenings and sometimes nights in the office. When I did come home, it would be well after 10 in the night. There were times when I had not seen my sister for 3 days in a row as she would be asleep by the time I came home and she would leave to college before I woke up in the morning. I thought things will change after college, but no... It stayed exactly the same even after I finished college. Even weekends were spent catching up with old customers or business contacts. There used to be at least one occasion every 2 days that would make me close my eyes, look up and think why is there only 24 hours in a day?? I am sure many of you can definitely relate to my situation here...</p>
<p>I feel bad. I really do feel very bad when I can't make time to help out around the house. No time to sit and watch an entire movie with family. The feeling of being unable to even have dinner together at the end of the day is a big let down.</p>
<p>After I left my company and started working for another small company, I thought everything will fall in place. My situation did improve, a lot in fact; but not as much as I'd wanted it to (or as much as my wife had wanted it to). I work from 9 AM to 6 PM. I have an option to work from home for 2 days in a month. I even take advantage of the flexibility offered to me by finishing the work soon and leaving the office by 5.30 PM to avoid rush hour. With all this in place, it sometimes leaves me wondering what more do I want to make this happen?? what more do I want to be successful at work and be there for my family??</p>
<p>Though I realize that there is no one complete solution, I have recently started doing some permutations and combinations of three simple things to tackle this problem. Schedule, Involve and Let things go.</p>
<p>I <strong>schedule</strong>. Right from waking up in the morning till sleeping in the night. I prepare a time table and write it down (planning to get a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/galaxynote800/index.html?type=find">Samsung Note 800</a> soon). Some things do not change from day to day like the time I wake up or the time I go to sleep, but most things do. So, I leave some buffer for contingencies. I try to stick to it as much as possible, but there will always be exceptions here and there (:-)... I am only human!!).</p>
<p>I <strong>involve</strong>. When I'm at home on weekdays I try to involve myself in other family members' day to day activities. I drop my sister to college, Accompany my wife, Help my mom out in the kitchen etc. I can see that all these small things gives them a happy feeling and definitely helps me stay sane.</p>
<p>I <strong>let things go</strong>. I am sure you have heard a hundred people say this in a thousand ways. What I mean by this is, I just do not get stuck on one thing after certain period of time, I let it go and come back to it later. It might be a new bug that was discovered yesterday night by the testing team or a critical new feature that needs to be designed by the end of the day, no exceptions. When I take time off, it doesn't mean I have forgotten about it, it is just pushed to the back of my mind until I get a fresh perspective on it or a change of scenery. Believe me, I have solved more problems and come up with better solutions when driving (or in the shower) than when at my desk staring at the computer screen.</p>
<p>These things definitely helps me stay more productive at work as well as spend a little extra quality time with my family. It is very easy to let the stress get to you and It will get to you only if you let it get to you.</p>
<p>These are some of the things I do. Tell me what do you do to tackle this. Who knows, together we may come up with a secret ingredient...</p>
