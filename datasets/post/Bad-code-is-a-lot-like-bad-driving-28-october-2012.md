Bad code is a lot like bad driving

Recently I had the chance to sit in the front seat of a bus while traveling from Goa to Bangalore. Due to oversleeping during the day I sat up and started staring outside the windshield watching all the things passing by.

It was a narrow stretch of road, there was a scooter at some distance in front of the bus, the driver was honking continuously asking the motorist to give way, well the motorist did not give way, The bus driver (going at about 80 KMPH) swerves dangerously to the right overtaking the motorist and while myself and others in the bus were scrambling to hold on to whatever available to prevent ourselves from being thrown out of our seats the driver once again swerves dangerously back to the left to avoid collision with an oncoming car. Here is the best part. The driver does not slow down let alone stop, he did not even look back to check whether all the passengers were all right, he just continued driving as though nothing had happened.

This got me thinking about why the driver was so rash. I later realized that it was because he was trying to reach the destination early. Is this a valid reason to put his own life and all the other passengers' lives at risk?? I am sure that the driver knew that he was driving really bad (I say this 'cos he slowed down and drove better after this incident) Is there any reason for such behavior??

Writing bad code is also a lot like this bad driving. According to me, there is simply not one valid reason in the world a developer can give to justify doing bad design or writing bad code.

Well, these are some of the reasons why I say this.

1. Though driving badly might get you to your destination there is no guarantee that it will, just like how writing bad code might also give you the necessary output there is no guarantee that it will.
2. There is no reliability of any sort. 
3. There is fear and doubt about reaching your destination just like the fear and doubt whether the necessary output is going to be obtained.
4. And the worst, you might not reach your destination at all. 

In this process the person who is driving badly is also putting other drivers and pedestrians at huge risk for no fault of theirs. Just like how one developer, who is writing bad code, is making the lives of all others involved in the process of working with that code, more difficult.

Apart from dealing with anti patterns like hard coding, magic numbers, soft code etc, I also constantly come across gold plating, input kludge etc. The worst among these is the bystander effect. The occurrence of these anti patterns happen so often in our day to day lives that it becomes almost impossible to differentiate these from good coding practices.

Though this entire topic is highly subjective, I would like to end by saying _"Just because the code is giving correct output it doesn't mean it is right"_
