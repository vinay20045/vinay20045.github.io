The Way We Work

It's been 6 months since I joined [CommonFloor.com (CF)][1], a real estate portal largely dedicated to apartments and gated communities. It is time that I wrote about the culture & work environment here.

A few days after I floated my resume in July/August of 2012, I got a mail from a recruiter asking me to apply for a senior development position at CF. Having been an entrepreneur right out of college, I was a little picky where I wanted to work. I did my homework, came to know that CF was Founded by a [group of IIT techies][2] in 2007, is backed by 2 VC biggies, has a group of experienced people in the management and some really awesome engineers in the tech team. I decided to give it a shot.

I spoke to [Lalit][3] (one of the founders) over phone and an interview was scheduled. Having had the opportunity to interview a good number of engineers and developers in my entrepreneurial life, I knew exactly what to expect in the interview that I was going to attend on a Monday morning. After what started out as a normal interview for which I was prepared, it suddenly changed course. We seemed to be having an open heart to heart from one entrepreneur to another. We discussed opportunities, rejections and refusals, some of my achievements, my recognitions, his idea of CF, how it started, where it is now and what kind of people run the place etc. I decided then and there ok, he is definitely one of the people I have to work with.

I have had the opportunity to work for and with 100s of small and medium sized businesses through my [start up][4]. There are some things that I have realized during this time. Nobody will tell you what to do or what not to do. There is nobody to tell you which is right or which is wrong (except, of course, until I decided to marry my [business partner][5]). You get your facts straight and your math right, just ship what you have developed as fast as you can and the customer (who is rightly called the King!!) will throw it right back at your face if he/she doesn't like it and you start all over again tracing back, realizing and correcting what you think you did wrong... bitter truth of life!!
 
I'm currently working as a Tech Lead at CF. Even after being in business for more than 5 years, CF still has a vibrant start up style of working. This is especially true in the Product & Engineering Team (P & E Team, of which I speak about from here onwards). No frills, no set in stone hierarchies, just an open work culture where people are ever willing to give and receive feedback. 

CF has 2 verticals, Real Estate and [AMS][6]. Part of my responsibilities include heading the real estate vertical (though I was very very interested to join AMS... sigh!!). The best part is I get to model, design & code for at least 30% of my time. I am, in fact trying to do more of this and nobody seems to be stopping me. This is what makes CF unique. People here respect what you want to do as an individual... There is a soft nudge when what you want is totally off course from what the business wants, but hey,  c'mon, we live in the real world right?

At CF, we don't have dedicated project managers who are big shot MBAs and don't know squat about development. Now that I think about it, all the people in the P & E Team are either engineers or have had some sort of development orientation in their careers. We have an awesome bunch of Product Managers who are the product owners. I literally mean it when I say awesome because, the dimensions of thought that they bring in and the kind of analysis that they do before deciding to get a feature developed is mind boggling.

Let me tell you the kind of people who are there in the engineering team. I work with...
    
- Lead QA Engineers who accommodate quick fixes even when they are just about done for the day at 7 PM.
- QA Engineers who have helped to complete a major server migration task which ended at about 2 AM in the morning and still were available during peak traffic time (10 - 11 AM) to verify if everything was working fine.
- Lead Engineers who do detailed code reviews for their peers at 11 PM in the night just because they know that somebody will be eagerly waiting for it in the morning.
- Senior Engineers who have 4 tasks under execution, which the product team itself has classified as major ones, but still have completed each and every one of them with minimal/no bugs and pushed it to production in 2 days just because it was made clear that they are critical.
- Engineers who are so good at learning new stuff and implementing them quickly that the job that these guys have done has resulted in direct positive impact on business metrics.
- Junior Developers who feel terrible and personally responsible when a bug is found in their code and pointed out.
- Interns who follow up at least thrice a day to make sure that the project they are working on is pushed to production as early as possible.
- People who walked in happily and fully charged for a bug day held on a Saturday in the recent past.
- People who realize that the code that they write will impact several lakhs of users when it goes to production the next day!!

This is how dreams/ideas are realized at CF. An idea begins its journey mostly in some stakeholders head and makes its way to the notice of one or more of the product managers where it either gets rejected or gets a makeover as a development feature and lands in the development queue depending on it's priority, importance and several other criteria. From here, one of the developer pulls the task to his queue and completes it. This is then picked up by the QA team which turns it inside out and certifies it as fit for release. Then the release manager decides to send it with the day's release to be available in production from the next day onwards.

Yes, we have priority queues. Yes, we have pull workflows. Yes, bugs are also treated similarly. Yes, we have daily releases. No, we don't have time boxes. Yes, we have stand ups. No, we don't predict the future and Yes, the business seems to be happy about it and encourages us. Yeeeeeeeaaaaaah!!!

Not that we don't do estimation. Predictability is a really big component in planning for success. Personally, I feel estimation is a lot more than just promising ETA based on some prior experience on similar tasks. Estimation is an art of coming together and figuring it out!! This is the stage where I am already modelling the db or writing the code in my head with the help of my peers. We do it. As a betterment exercise.

We are not perfect. There are times when there is a push on certain items. There are times when things take longer than expected. There are times when the task that you have your eyes set on is pulled out of the queue or pushed down 'cause of change in priority. There are times when the decibel level is 2 points up than usual, but it all settles itself out by the end of the day when we are fighting about which pizza to order or which song to play.

I can go on and on about this...
